### Overview

At this point in its development, the `ggArtsyR()` package works with `ggplot2()` to add an additional color palette to the user’s repertoire. This is the goghColors dataset, which contains the RGB codes of colors picked from Van Gogh paintings. It also has a function that work alongside `ggplot2()` to create more interesting data visualizations and add contextual information to the user’s plots. This main function is `RectangleFiller()`, which divides data visualizations into a specified number of colored quadrants based on the number of input colors, improving the readability of graphs. 

### Usage example

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Hidden chunk because it is setup for example
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggRtsy)
library(purrr)
plotExample <- ggplot(starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous()
```

Using Hex Codes from the dataset `goghColors`, three colors were added on top of a `ggplot` sample scatter plot. Based on the plot, the function automatically calculated three equal widths of the rectangles, and stretched them to upper and lower bounds on the y-axis. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
RectangleFiller(plotExample, c("#e32636", "#9966cc", "#f4c2c2"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#library(tayloRswift)
plotExample <- ggplot(starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  #scale_color_taylor(palette = "starryNight")+
  theme_minimal()
```

### Installation instructions

Get the development version from GitHub:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#Install remotes if needed:
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("katelyndiaz/ggRtsy")
```

And load it with

```{r}
library(ggRtsy)
```
