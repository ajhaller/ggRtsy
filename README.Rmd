# SDS270_Div2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

List of things to include in README from R Packages book, for our reference:

1. A paragraph that describes the high-level purpose of the package.

2. An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.

3. Installation instructions, giving code that can be copied and pasted into R.

4. An overview that describes the main components of the package. For more complex packages, this will point to vignettes for more details.



The goal of SDS270_Div2 is to create a minimally viable R package.

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
