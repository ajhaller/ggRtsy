### Overview

At this point in its development, the ggArtsyR package works with
`ggplot2()` to add an additional color palette to the user’s repertoire.
This is the goghColors dataset, which contains the RGB codes of colors
picked from Van Gogh paintings. It also has a function that work
alongside `ggplot2()` to create more interesting data visualizations and
add contextual information to the user’s plots. This main function is
`RectangleFiller()`, which divides data visualizations into colored
quadrants, improving the readability of graphs.

### Usage example
