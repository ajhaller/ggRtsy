```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggRtsy)
library(purrr)
plotExample <- ggplot(starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous()
```

The `ggArtsyR()` package works with `ggplot2()` to add an additional color palette to the user’s repertoire. This is the goghColors dataset, which contains the RGB codes of colors picked from Van Gogh paintings.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(goghColors,10))
```

## RectangleFiller()

ggRtsy also has a function that work alongside `ggplot2()` to create more interesting data visualizations and add contextual information to the user’s plots. This main function is `RectangleFiller()`, which divides data visualizations into a specified number of colored quadrants based on the number of input colors, improving the readability of graphs.

Using Hex Codes from the dataset `goghColors`, three colors were added on top of a `ggplot` sample scatter plot. Based on the plot, the function automatically calculated three equal widths of the rectangles, and stretched them to upper and lower bounds on the y-axis. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
RectangleFiller(plotExample, c("#e32636", "#9966cc", "#f4c2c2"))
```

## rgbToHex()

This package comes with rgbToHex, converting rgb colors into hex code colors.

```{r}
rgbToHex(c("(225, 104, 39)","(60, 90, 202)"))
```

## Gogh Painting Palettes

The dataset goghPaintingSets contains a list of every Gogh painting, some information about them, and a set of colors randomly pulled from it. This can be used to make your own Gogh themed colorsets.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(goghPaintingSets,4))
```


## gogh_palettes_pop

For ease of use, gogh_palettes_pop is a list of color palettes from the most well known Gogh paintings.

`sunflowers` = '#74A629', '#F2EB80', '#F2E085', '#BF9821', '#A6681C'
![`sunflowers`](https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/vincent-van-gogh/still-life-vase-with-fifteen-sunflowers-1888-1.jpg!Large.jpg)

The pallet can be used in graphs as so:

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```

You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML:

    output:
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        fig_caption: yes

Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**.

## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```
