## goghColors

The `ggArtsyR()` package works with `ggplot2()` to add an additional color palette to the user’s repertoire. This is the goghColors dataset, which contains the RGB and hex codes of colors picked from Van Gogh paintings.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(goghColors,10))
```

## RectangleFiller()

ggRtsy also has a function that work alongside `ggplot2()` to create more interesting data visualizations and add contextual information to the user’s plots. This main function is `RectangleFiller()`, which divides data visualizations into a specified number of colored quadrants based on the number of input colors, improving the readability of graphs.

Using Hex Codes from the dataset `goghColors`, three colors were added on top of a `ggplot` sample scatter plot. Based on the plot, the function automatically calculated three equal widths of the rectangles, and stretched them to upper and lower bounds on the y-axis. 

```{r}
RectangleFiller(plotExample, c("#e32636", "#9966cc", "#f4c2c2", "#e16827"))
```

## rgbToHex()

This package comes with rgbToHex, converting rgb colors into hex code colors.

```{r}
rgbToHex(c("(225, 104, 39)","(60, 90, 202)"))
```

## Gogh Painting Sets

The dataset goghPaintingSets contains a list of every Gogh painting, some information about them, and a set of colors randomly pulled from it. This can be used to make your own Gogh themed colorsets.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(goghPaintingSets,4))
```


## gogh_palettes_pop

For ease of use, gogh_palettes_pop is a list of color palettes from the most well known Gogh paintings.

`selfPortrait` = '#021F59', '#63A5BF', '#8C701C', '#BF9B6F', '#730202' 
![](https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/vincent-van-gogh/self-portrait-1889-1.jpg!Large.jpg){width=200px}

The pallet can be used in graphs as so:

```{r}
plotExample2 <- ggplot(exampleData, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_color_gogh(palette = "selfPortrait") +
  theme_minimal()
plotExample2
```
